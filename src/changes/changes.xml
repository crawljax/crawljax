		</release>

		<release version="2.0" date="2010-12-16"
			description="New major release. Concurrent multi-browser crawling.">
			<action dev="stefan" type="add">
				Support for concurrent multi-browser crawling. The number of browsers can be configured using the ThreadConfiguration API. 
			</action>
			<action dev="mesbah" type="add">
				Support added for the HTMLUnit driver. Note: this driver is very fast, but it is not a real browser. 
			</action>
			<action dev="mesbah" type="update" issue="9">
				Upgraded the dependencies on Selenium (version 2.0a7). 
			</action>
			<action dev="all" type="update">
				Various improvements and bug fixes.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="26">
				 The initial browser was null, this was caused by the fact that the currentBrowser was not correctly set.
				 The browser pool did not register the currentBrowser for a given thread as the browser got requested directly,
				 as what happened with the initial browser.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="27">
				 When running a (large) CrawlSpec and set a MaxRuntime constraint for it, the Crawler is not terminated directly
				 when the MaxRuntime is reached. Basically what happened was that the current Crawler was terminated.
				  Afterwards all waiting Crawlers got executed and start back-tracking and when in the previous state the check 
				  constraints terminates the Crawler. It was changed to, when the MaxRuntime is reached the current Crawler was 
				  terminated and that Crawler made a call the all other Crawlers running to shutdown and it tells the queue to
				  empty and shutdown.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="29">
				 Ignore iFrames specified by full identifier or using wild-card.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="30">
				 When using one wait condition during crawling and the first waitcondition takes a long time (> timeout) but in the
				 end it is successful a IndexOutOfBounceException is thrown. The index is increased after an successful execution of
				 a waitcondition and later the log event uses the increased index number to retrieve the WaitCondition that took to
				 long to get successful.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="31">
				 When supplying wrong or malformed urllocator causes an exception. Changed the behaviour not to suspect an urllocator
				 starts with 7 characters.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="32">
				 The exactEventPath got updated when OnNewState plugins where finished executing. This resulted in the wrong data being
				 exposed to the CrawlSession. The initial fix was made to prevent this behaviour, late the CrawlPath and the ExactEventPath
				 where merged because both lists are doing exactly the same.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update" issue="33/34">
				 Refactored most of the Exception handling within Crawljax, when a browser crashed (for whatever reason) the Exception thrown
				 by WebDriver was catched and ignored. Resulting in all calls to WebDriver to fail and by that flushing all the work from the
				 queue by Crawlers using that Browser. The new implementation handles the exception at the right location and makes sure the
				 crashed browser will be removed from the pool and won’t be used any further. The crawler where the browser crashed will be
				 removed from the queue, limiting the number of missed states by the number that would have been found by that crawler.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="add">
				 Added CrawlPathToException class to wrap a crawl path into a stack trace like exception giving developers / testers better insight
				 into on which page an invariant or plugin reported an error.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update">
				 Fixed a lot of the FindBugs warnings, remove some legacy code (clone() support)
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update">
				 Updated the WebDriver version, this was needed to support screenshots for RemoteWebDrivers. It also enables screenshotting 
				 of WebDriver instances wrapping an other WebDriver by implementing the WrapsDriver class. This enabled screenshotting in 
				 EventFiringWebDriver classes.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="add">
				 Added a Filter option to Helper.getDifferences, so a list of differences can be generated without being bothered with
				 the changes in style attributes for example.
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update">
				 Changed Crawljax Core so a CrossBrowser tool could be developed; therefore added an call to block the CrawljaxController (waitForTermination).
			</action>
			<action dev="stefan" type="update">
				 When having allot elements to examine prevent getXPathExpression get called over and over again. This was solved by caching the build
				 of the XPath’s in the current DOM. Every node in the DOM contains the full xPath leading to it self, so preventing to calculate for 
				 example the /HMTL/BODY part over and over again. Only calculate the part which has not yet been calculated.
			</action>
			<action dev="frank" type="update">
				 Rename BrowserFactory to BrowserPool which is a more correct name.
			</action>
		</release>
