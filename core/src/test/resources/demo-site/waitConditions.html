<h1>WaitConditions</h1>

<p>Websites can have widgets that load relatively slow, which can cause flakyness in the crawling or while testing. With WaitConditions the user can specify that in wich url (or part of the url) Crawljax should wait for certain elements or widgets to become visible.<p/>

<h2>Methods in CrawlSpecification</h2>
<p>
<span class="java">
waitFor(String url, ExpectedCondition...expectedConditions) {<br />
waitFor(String url, int timeout, ExpectedCondition...expectedConditions)
</span>
</p>


<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Wait for a list to be loaded on the #contact page.</p>
<pre>
CrawlSpecification crawler = new CrawlSpecification(URL);
...
crawler.waitFor("#contact", new ExpectedVisibleCondition(By.id("contactList")));
</pre>

<h3>Note: currently only supported when WebDriver is used</h3>
