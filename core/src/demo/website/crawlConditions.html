<h1>CrawlConditions</h1>

<p>Crawljax has CrawlConditions which can be used to guide the crawling with a dynamic approach. When Crawljax finds a new state, it only crawls it when <strong>all</strong> the CrawlConditions are satisfied. If no CrawlConditions are specified, all the states are crawled.</p>

<h2>Methods in CrawlSpecification</h2>
<p>
<span class="java">
addCrawlCondition(String description, Condition crawlCondition)<br />
addCrawlCondition(String description, Condition crawlCondition, Condition... preConditions)
</span>
</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>Crawljax should onlyl crawl pages with the text foo in the URL.</p>
<pre>
CrawlSpecification crawler = new CrawlSpecification(URL);
...  
UrlCondition onlyFooDomain = new UrlCondition("foo"));
crawler.addCrawlCondition("Only crawl foo site", onlyFooDomain);
</pre>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Crawljax should never crawl a page with a <span class="foo">span with the class 'foo'</span>.</p>
<pre>
CrawlSpecification crawler = new CrawlSpecification(URL);
...
NotXPathCondition noFooClass = new NotXPathCondition("//SPAN[@class='foo']"));
crawler.addCrawlCondition("No spans with foo as class", noFooClass);
</pre>

<p>This page contains a <span class="foo">foo</span> and should therefore not be crawled by Crawljax. <a href="#" onclick="addError('Should not crawl this page');">Thus think link should not be clicked by Crawljax</a></p>
